Thermistor
==========

This library provides a simple API for the thermistors.
The default configuration assumes that a vultage divider is used,
in which the fixed resistor has the same value as the nominal
resistance of the thermistor.

As a reference, please see the thermistor block provided by FlamingoEda.
It mounts an NTC TTC03 thermistor, Part No. TTC3A103F34D1X03 with:

- Beta = 3435 ±1%
- R25 = 10K ±1%
